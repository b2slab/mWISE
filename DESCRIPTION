Description: mWISE provides a set of strategies to annotate untargeted LC-MS 
    data.
    Given a peak-intensity table as input, mWISE applies three main steps 
    aimed at i) matching  mass-to-charge ratio values to KEGG database, ii) clustering 
    and filtering the potential KEGG candidates and iii) building a final prioritized 
    list using diffusion in networks. 
    mWISE takes advantage of biological pathways knowledge to improve the
    annotation confidence level.
